                        Having access to nutritious food is a human right. According to research, every 10 seconds, a child dies from the effects of hunger. 
                        690 million people are going hungry, 2 billion suffer from malnutrition. It's high time that we need to act upon it; otherwise, 
                        the situation will worsen.</p>
                        <p>
                        There are enough food, knowledge, and resources for all. We lack the prevention of food wastage and equal distribution of food among 
                        all sections of society.

                            <b>Hunger Demons</b> is a non-profitable project launched for the welfare of society. The main motive of this project is 
                            to design interventions to reduce hunger among underserved communities across the world.
                        </p>

                            We strongly believe that the community can play a significant role in eliminating the menace of hunger. We encourage people 
                            having an excess of fresh food to donate it to the ones who need it. It will also prevent food wastage.
